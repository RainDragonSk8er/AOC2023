# Welcome to the Holme++ Advent of Code repository
Feel free to add your solutions to the days' problems by adding a directory under the specific day directories for each day during advent with your own name. ex.:
```bash shell
AOC2023/Des-01/insert_your_name_here/coding_language/ (solution)
```
This can be done quickly by adding your name to the list in the [treemaker]: https://github.com/RainDragonSk8er/AOC2023/blob/main/bin/U-Utilities/treemaker.sh script, and running it locally before pushing it.
